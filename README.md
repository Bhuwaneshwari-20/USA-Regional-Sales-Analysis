# USA-Regional-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview

#### This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Acme Co.’s USA sales data from 2014 to 2018, followed by the creation of a Power BI dashboard for data visualization. The analysis uncovers key insights into revenue and profit drivers, seasonal trends, outliers, and performance against budgets across products, channels, and regions. The dashboard enhances decision-making for pricing, promotions, and market expansion strategies.
